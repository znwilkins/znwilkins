      To support my education, I work at a graphics company.<br><br>
      Through my work, I have learned much about design, organization,<br>
      and the printing process.<br><br>
      I have had the opportunity to work on jobs for large clients,<br>
      such as Canada Post, Hudson's Bay, and Hockey Night in Canada.<br><br>
      See some of my work below!

    <p style="text-align:center; padding:5px;"><em>June 2016.<br>
      Vehicle Wrap. Screen and digital print, with computer cut vinyl.</em><br><br>
      This project involved wrapping 235 delivery trucks across Canada.<br><br>
      I was responsible for setting up the artwork for proof,
      and print,<br> and then supervising the project
      as it was produced.

    <p style="text-align:center; padding:5px;"><em>June 2013.<br>
      Vehicle Wrap. Digital print, with computer cut vinyl.</em><br><br>
      This project, while featuring a simple design, was deceptively challenging.<br><br>
      The entire project was completed in one week, from proof to
      installation.<br>
      Colour match was paramount because I was using two wide-format digital printers.

    <p style="text-align:center; padding:5px;"><em>May 2013.<br>
      Vehicle Wrap. Digital print, with computer cut vinyl.</em><br><br>
      This project is a personal favourite, because it's just plain cool.<br><br>
      The design on this wrap featured many shadows and transparencies,<br>
      which often cause trouble for raster image processors.<br>
      To combat this, I printed many of the components separately,<br>
      which were then trimmed to size.
